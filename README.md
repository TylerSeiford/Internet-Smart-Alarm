# Internet-Smart-Alarm
This project contains all of the code for a Photon based IoT alarm clock.
## Hardware
This project used a Particle Photon Microcontroiller for controlling three I2C LED matrixes (8x8) and it's IoT libraries.  The function of this project was to create an alarm that required the user to input the answer to math problems to shut it off.  In our implementation the program would randomly generate two numbers and an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `modulus`) and require the user to input the answer either on a webpage or with a simple button.

## Assignment
This project was done as a final assignment for my EE 1301 class freshman year.
